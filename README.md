### Tips
If you really want to learn shader programming, I don't recommend HLSL as a first language due to it being a bit weird with syntax. While it is still user friendly, GLSL provides a much simpler syntax!

If you don't want to learn HLSL, go on a website like [shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and experiment there, otherwise the only other option I can recommend is [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) 

### Difficulty
#### SuperEasy - Easiest, recommended for newbies to shaders!
#### Easy - Easier, recommended for people with a little shader experience!
#### Medium - More difficult, recommended for people who understand shader basics!
#### Hard - Super difficult, recommended for people who understand more complex shader topics and want to make complex effects!
